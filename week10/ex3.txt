ANSWER to the question:
Each number is the sum of values that specify read (4), write (2), and execute (1) access, with 0 (zero) meaning no access.(according to https://kb.iu.edu/d/abdb)
So:
660 - read and write permissions for user and group
775 - read, write and execute permissons for user and group, read and execute for others
777 - read, write and execute permissions for all
