The first program outputs a string "Hello" and goes to next line (does this seqence of steps twice)
The second program outputs a string "Hello". Then it goes to the next line twice.

Explanation:
Due to line buffering of stdout, printf prints string only after \n or when the buffer is full.
In the first case both processes have "Hello" in the buffers after fork(). When printf() is called, it prints
  the contents of the buffers (now "Hello\n").
In the second case before fork() is called and after printf("Hello\n"), parent's buffer empties.
  So, after forking, the buffers of both processes are empty and printf("\n") prints only "\n"
